## Highlights

- Shows your Codex plan, 5-hour quota, weekly quota, and next reset time in a compact always-on-top widget.
- Uses clear quota states for healthy, caution, and critical remaining usage.
- Collapses into a small floating orb when idle, then expands on hover.
- Indicates whether quota is currently being consumed.
- Includes persistent expansion, always-on-top controls, and localized tray actions.
- Falls back to a clearly marked weekly-quota view when the 5-hour window is unavailable.
- Checks for app updates automatically and supports signed in-app updates on Windows.
- Shows reset credit count and available reset-credit expiration times when the quota service provides them.
- Handles stale data, signed-out sessions, unavailable quota responses, and loading states without fabricating values.

## How It Works

Quota Float reads the existing Codex Desktop login state on your machine and queries Codex/ChatGPT quota endpoints with that session. It does not estimate usage from local token counts and does not redeem reset credits or modify account settings.

Browser preview uses mock data. Real quota reading requires the Tauri desktop app and an existing Codex Desktop login on the same machine.

## Download

For normal users, download the latest installer from GitHub Releases:

- Latest release: https://github.com/change-42-yhmm/quota-float/releases/latest
- Windows: use the `.exe` or `.msi` installer.
- macOS Universal: use the `.dmg` bundle.

Updater artifacts are signed with the project's Tauri update key. Windows Authenticode signing and macOS notarization are separate platform-signing steps; builds without those certificates may still trigger SmartScreen or Gatekeeper warnings.

## Feedback

Please use GitHub Issues for bugs, compatibility reports, and feature requests:

## Privacy Boundary

Quota Float is local-first and intentionally narrow:

- Reads the local Codex Desktop login state only to query Codex quota.
- Sends the existing Codex access token only to ChatGPT quota endpoints.
- Stores only widget preferences in its own app config directory.
- Does not store Codex tokens, account IDs, prompts, chat history, raw quota responses, or local auth paths.
- Does not include telemetry, analytics, crash reporting, or third-party tracking.
- Does not redeem reset credits or modify account settings.

See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full boundary.

## Accuracy Boundary

Codex quota is read from Codex/ChatGPT quota service responses. If the response format changes, the app shows an unavailable or stale state instead of inventing quota values.

## Development

Requirements:

- Node.js 20+
- Rust stable
- Tauri 2 system dependencies for your platform

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run test
npm run build
npm run tauri dev
```

After Codex Desktop updates, run the compatibility check:

```bash
npm run check:codex
```

See [docs/CODEX-UPDATE-CHECK.md](docs/CODEX-UPDATE-CHECK.md) for the automated update-check workflow and optional Task Scheduler setup.

## Build

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

On Windows, Tauri may download WiX to create an MSI installer. If WiX download fails, the release executable may still be produced at:

```text
src-tauri/target/release/quota-float.exe
```

## Release

GitHub Actions are configured for:

- CI on push/PR: frontend tests, Rust tests, web build, Tauri build.
- `v*` tags: Windows and macOS Universal installers, updater signatures, `latest.json`, and a public GitHub Release.

See [docs/GITHUB-RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md](docs/GITHUB-RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md) before publishing a version for others.

Do not upload local credentials, `.codex`, `.env*`, screenshots with personal data, `node_modules`, `dist`, `src-tauri/target`, or local installers to source control.
